# Landing Page for Recurse Center Jobs

This is a mock-up design for the Recurse Center's (RC) interview prep sessions.

## Design Thoughts

Users come from various experiences. We wanted the page to reflect that. The top section has statements that users understand. Then, they interact with content that is most relevant to them and where they are in the interview process.

This is a logical progression through the process, and it is signified by the timeline.

The green colors and monospace font reflect the RC community.
